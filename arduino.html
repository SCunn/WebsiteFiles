<table width="100%" border="1" summary="For this project, I will be creating an interactive narrative based game.  This game will explore the habits of how humans communicate with disembodied voices in a fixed space using the somewhat dead activity of the telephone conversation. This work explores the nostalgic elements of how we used to communicate.  The game will be programmed to play audio clips of telephone conversations, some clips may be familiar to the player.  Like Christian Marclay’s  work, I intend to create a macro-narrative using what the player could be familiar with, and with what they are not.
•	When the game is inactive (when the receiver has been down) the phone will ring to attract new players
•	When the player answers, the process will begin.  The player would then be prompted by an audio file
•	The audio files will be clips from telephone conversations, the player would then have to listen out for keywords from the clips to get to the next phase.
•	The keywords listed in a notepad placed next to the phone
